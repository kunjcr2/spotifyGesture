# SpotifyGesture

> A basic program to manage spotify's primary operations with gestures

What if you want to control your spotify without changin to spotify ?

Well, you can leave this app running in background and just use the hand gestures to control your spotify.

I used
1. OpenCV (for camera access)
2. MediaPipe (for landmark detection)

For more information, kindly connect with me as this is an older code.
